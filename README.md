Pandakoid is a browser-based game inspired by the arcade classic **_Arkanoid_**. The goal is to destroy all the blocks on the screen before the panda ball hits the ground.

## Instructions

Press the enter key to start the game. You will use the left and right arrows to move the bamboo stick to bounce the panda back up and prevent it from falling. There are two different power-ups. One will prevent a panda ball from falling to the ground and the other will give you more panda balls. When all your panda balls hit the ground, you lose!
